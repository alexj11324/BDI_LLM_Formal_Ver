# Plan: Evaluate "AlphaXiv MCP" and SOTA BDI-LLM Methods

## Phase 0: Research & Discovery (Completed)
- **Goal**: Identify "AlphaXiv MCP" and benchmark user's proposed methods (GRPO, MIPRO, VGS) against 2026 SOTA.
- **Findings**:
    - "AlphaXiv MCP" is a bridge to AlphaXiv (arXiv discussion platform).
    - User's methods (GRPO, MIPRO, VGS) are current SOTA.
    - Newer trends: Neuro-Symbolic RL (Verifier as Reward), AlphaCodium/Flow Engineering (MCTS/Beam Search).
- **Status**: Completed via subagent.

## Phase 1: Comparative Analysis
- **Goal**: Structure the comparison between user's proposal and industry best practices.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Mapping: Map GRPO/MIPRO/Constitutional AI to the "Neuro-Symbolic" trend.
    2. Gap Analysis: Identify what's missing (e.g., Tree Search vs Retry Loop).
    3. AlphaXiv Context: Explain how AlphaXiv MCP aids this research (real-time discussion retrieval).

## Phase 2: Final Report Generation
- **Goal**: Answer the user's question "Is my subsequent method the best?".
- **Tasks**:
    1. Confirm user's methods are SOTA.
    2. Highlight specific strengths (GRPO for efficiency, MIPRO for metric alignment).
    3. Suggest "Best of N" or Tree Search as the next logical step (AlphaCodium style).
    4. Explain AlphaXiv MCP's role in keeping up with this fast-moving field.

## Verification
- Check if "AlphaXiv" was correctly identified.
- Ensure all user-listed methods (Part 2 of proposal) are addressed.
